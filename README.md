DISCLAIMER
The dataset used within this analysis was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. 
The aim of this dissertation research was to identify statistically significant, differentially expressed genes between permanent arial fibrilaltion (pmAF) and sinus rhythm patients.
Specific focus was placed on identifying senescent genes using senescent genes retrieved from Rai et al., 2014 (doi: 10.1101/gad.247528.114).
Identified senescent genes were further analysed to identify the role of senescence in pmAF and using a support vector machine algorithm the predictive capabilities of these signatures was assessed.
Specifically, this repository contains code for data cleaning and preprocssing, differential expression analysis, pathway analysis and machine learning.
